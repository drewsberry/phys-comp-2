# Todo
----------------------------------

## Introduction
- [ ] Remove pointless stuff lifted from transcript
- [ ] Find other references and include information from them.
- [ ] Expand on difference between Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel methods.

## Solving Laplace Equation in 2D
- [ ] Write about effect of altering the grid density.
- [ ] Write about effect of altering convergence condition.
- [ ] Include timings of various different choices.
- [ ] Let user input matrix as file.
- [ ] Write method to neatly print out resulting matrix so that it can be externally plotted.
- [ ] Look into making GUI with Tkinter/Ttk/PyQt/Enthought Canopy, if I've got time (not priority)

## Capacitor Problem
- [ ] Finish animation
- [ ] Change number of contours in /multimedia/cont_anim.py
- [ ] Set number of contours in /multimedia/cont_anim.py to 100 as per laplace_plot.py
- [ ] Change width from 50 to 100 in multimedia/{surf,cont}_anim.py
- [ ] Seriously consider reducing the grid density and/or number of frames for animations. It's simply taking too long to run.

## Heat Diffusion Problem
- [ ] Start heat diffusion problem - SOON! DON'T WANT SAME THING AS LAST TIME TO HAPPEN!
