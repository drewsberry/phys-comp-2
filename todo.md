# Todo
----------------------------------

## Introduction
- [x] Remove pointless stuff lifted from transcript
- [x] Find other references and include information from them.
- [x] Expand on difference between Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel methods.

## Solving Laplace Equation in 2D
- [x] Write about effect of altering the grid density.
- [x] Write about effect of altering convergence condition.
- [x] Include timings of various different choices.
- [x] Let user input matrix as file.
- [x] Write method to neatly print out resulting matrix so that it can be externally plotted.
- [x] Look into making GUI with Tkinter/Ttk/PyQt/Enthought Canopy, if I've got time (not priority)

## Capacitor Problem
- [x] Finish animation
- [x] Change number of contours in /multimedia/cont_anim.py
- [x] Set number of contours in /multimedia/cont_anim.py to 100 as per laplace_plot.py
- [x] Change width from 50 to 100 in multimedia/{surf,cont}_anim.py
- [x] Seriously consider reducing the grid density and/or number of frames for animations. It's simply taking too long to run.

## Heat Diffusion Problem
- [x] Start heat diffusion problem - SOON! DON'T WANT SAME THING AS LAST TIME TO HAPPEN!
