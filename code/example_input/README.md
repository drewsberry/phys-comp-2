Input Matrices
--------------

 >Input matrices should where no boundary conditions are specified have "None" (*not* 0) as their element.

 >Input matrices should be space or tab separated, *not* comma separated (as Python's split() method doesn't like comma separated data).

 >Any values whatsoever can be input, but bear in mind that putting in boundary conditions of a drastically different order of 1 requires setting the error to an appropriate values (this can be done with the '--error' or '-e' flags.
