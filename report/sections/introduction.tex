\section{Introduction}

In this exercise three problems are solved. Firstly, a program is written to solve the Laplace equation in two dimensions using the method of finite difference. This is then applied to the parallel plate capacitor and compared to the idealised infinite plate parallel plate capacitor and its properties. Finally, the heat diffusion equation is solved for an iron rod using the implicit finite difference method, and by solving a set of linear equations to iterate forwards in time.
