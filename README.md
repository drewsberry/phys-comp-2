Computational Physics 301, Exercise 2
-------------------------------------

This contains the files for the code and report of Exercise 2 of Computational Physics 301, entitled "Partial Differential Equations". The exercise contains three parts:

- Solving Laplace's equation in two dimensions;
- Solving the electric potential of a finite capacitor, investigating in particular the limit of an infinite place capacitor;
- Solving the heat diffusion equation for a hot metal rod.

This branch contains the `LaTeX` code for the report at the end of the piece of coursework.

To compile, simply run:

```bash
$ pdflatex main && pdflatex main # Run twice for cross-references
```
